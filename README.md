# 🙋‍♂️ Hello, I'm Antonio García

👨‍💻 I'm a **UX Designer & FrontEnd Engenieer** from Barcelona.

I am a design and technology enthusiast 💞 with a long career and an innovative spirit.

I started out as a graphic designer 👨‍🎨, but the use of computers made me discover a world full of possibilities. 🤩

This has led me to collaborate with great companies and their technological projects, always using the latest technologies. 🤖
